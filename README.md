Testing bit.

to more information about how to install bvm (bit version manager) see the documentation:

https://bit.dev/docs/getting-started/installing-bit/installing-bit

you can learn how to install bvm and use it to install/(upgrade to) bit's last version available

in resume, you have to run:

(to install npx, see the documentation): https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx / https://pt.stackoverflow.com/questions/433378/qual-a-diferen%C3%A7a-entre-npm-e-npx

on your command prompt

once you have this installed, clone this repository to your computer by using git (see the documentation if you haven't git installed)

git clone https://github.com/leonardo-coutinho-dev/bit-first-repository

and run the following code on the terminal in your bit-first-project directory
